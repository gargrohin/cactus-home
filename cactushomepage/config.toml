  description = "Hi! Welcome to my little corner on the internet. My name is Rohin. I currently program robots to see, think and move at UCSD Contextual Robotics Institute. What I really want to do is solve problems using technology and by working with people with different backgrounds and skills. Maybe that's why I chose to study Robotics and CS. But I also like to tinker with design tech, study about (decentralized) financial tech, and brush my software engineeirng skills whenever possible. <p> Check out the above sections to know more about my work! </p>"
